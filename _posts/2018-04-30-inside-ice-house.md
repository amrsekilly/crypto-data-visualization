summary: "EPISODE 23: Dr. Adam Back, the co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of hashcash, visits the ICE House to discuss his career and the future of the block chain and financial cryptography. Over the last year, we've seen steep run-ups in the price of cryptocurrencies, often followed by precipitous falls. In spite of this extreme volatility, the crypto markets continues to grow and some estimate it could reach a valuation as high as $1 trillion in 2018."
